# LabsTwo

Journal, I have been learning about 'true and false' and different codes that mean the same thing, I have also been learning about =,==,=== and the different uses for each one.
I have learnt these as its really useful in coding to understand all of these and how they work
I have learnt this through using Visual Studio Code, various websites and our classes gitbook. Along with the help of my Tutor Ali.

I now know the difference between true and flase, also the variations between =,==,===
The point is to get familiar with these codes and to try and remember them.
I will remember these through using 'FreeCampCodes' and 'MDN', and trying my hardest to retain the knowledge learnt in class

The real life applications for these, to my understanding is quite frequently used in day to day coding.
To fill in any gaps that i may have forgotten I will use the above stated websites, and ask my tutor or classmates on anything I'm not sure about.
